# Google-stock-price-prediction
Machine Learning: This project aims to forecast future continous prices of Google stocks with machine learning regression algorithms

## The Project
A stock market is a public place where you can buy and sell shares for publicly listed companies, such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. The stock, also known as equities, represents ownership of the company, and the stock exchange is the mediator that allows the buying and selling of shares.
Some importance of the stock markets includes helping companies to raise capital, generating personal wealth, serving as an indicator of the state or nation's economy, and it is widely used as source for people to invest money in companies with high growth potential

## Description
Stock price prediction using machine learning helps to discover the future value of a company stock and other financial asset traded over exchange, as according to simplilearn.com, the entire idea of stock prediction is to gain significant profit. Predicting how stocks will perform or the value of future stock prices is usually a complicated task to achieve, as there could be other factors involved in the prediction, such as physical and psychological factors, rational and irrational behaviour,including fundamental factors and so on. All these factors combine together to make the shares volatile and dynamic. This usually makes it difficult to achieve an infinitely high accuracy, however though, with the help machine learning and some of it's relevant algorithms, we have an edge.

In essence, as earlier stated, this project will aim to forecast continuous prices of Google stock with machine learning regression algorithms.
